    <h1>&#128187 Lab 10 Problem 3 (making a simple webpage) &#128187</h1>
    <p>I decided to use Django for building my webpage because it has lots of cool features,
        it's free to use, and it's pretty powerful and easy for anyone to work with. To get it on my
        computer, I followed the steps on the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django website</a>.
        I also made a virtual space for my project to keep it separate from everything else. Once that
        was set up, I used a command "startproject" to create the basic structure of my project.</p>
    <p>For making the webpage, I used python language in Django to create HTML files that shows my
        "hi-world" html file. The database and server stuff was handled by Django. To see
        how it looked, I used a command "runserver" to start a development server, and then I could check it out in
        my web browser.</p>
    <p>The trickiest part was getting the web connection right. I had to tweak some settings in the Django
        setup, run a command to lunch the appropriately named website. I sorted it out by reading the
        Django documentation, double-checking the settings, and using the Django shell to make sure the
        information was getting saved and connecting properly.</p>
    <p>I was able to overcome these difficulties by researching the Django documentation and making sure
        that the settings were correct. Also, watching some tutorials gave me many insights.</p>
